Model description       :
	Wrokdam Von Gadmoore was a legendary arena gladiator in his time.
	He had no greater love than the glory of combat and spent
	his entire life shaping his body and mind into the perfect weapon.
	Tragically, a warrior’s prime fades quickly.
	Wrokdam could feel the years catching up and it infuriated him.
	He swore he would never allow weakness to prevail even if his body
	betrayed him.  He decided to combat death itself through the use of
	cybernetics and began replacing parts of his body he felt had grown
	too weak to be useful in battle. He thought he had found true
	immortality.  He was terribly mistaken
	As time passed, Wrokdam slowly slipped into madness.
	His mind could not endure the time his new body could and he
	soon lost himself to the machine.

	Now the monster known as Wrokdam wanders the world
	in search of combat and no one knows if any part of his soul
	still lives.



Other info              :
	This was a project for a class I'm taking and my first
	attempt at building a character for Quake 3. I
	had to learn everything as I went and juggle
	other classes so please excuse the length of time 
	it took.  Wrockdam is kind of fun to watch and play
	as. I hope everyone like him.
