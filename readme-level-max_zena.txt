* Description * 

- About this map
It's a map about the heart of the city I was born 43 years ago.. GENOA, ITALY, as I remember it, not an actual simulation. 

I think this will enjoy both street action and snipers addicted. It's really large but detailed too.

* AW&F innovates SOF2 MP gameplay! *

- Two control rooms (one for each team) are located in vehicles and available in CTF, DEM, INF mode
  Control room includes VIRTUAVU and GPS PASSALERT original AW&F technology  (nothing more tham PORTAL, DOORS and TRIGGERS but creatively implemented :D) 
- VIRTUAVU is a portal implementation, you can monitor movements on the map from above.
- GPS PASSALERT is an alert system available at control rooms. An audio-visual feedback is produced when the enemy pass through several checkpoints wisely located in the map

Other orignal features:
- "Stocastic reflections on water" shader
- "Underwater" triggered sound
- "Chitarra romana song" realistic reverbered audio reproduction using multiple sound sources and differerent samples (test it in "Piazza Banchi" location)
- "Pidgeonfly.efx" has been developed using EffectsEd from Ravensoft
