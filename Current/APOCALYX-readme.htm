<a name="whatisthis"><b>1 - What is APOCALYX?</b>
---------------------</a>

The &quot;APOCALYX 3D Engine&quot; is an OpenGL based 3D engine with
interesting features and powerful scripting capabilities.

The manual of the engine is accessible from the file:
<a href="APOCALYX-manual-index.htm">APOCALYX-manual-index.htm</a>.

To get scripted demos of the engine visit the Downloads page
at <a href="http://apocalyx.sourceforge.net">http://apocalyx.sourceforge.net</a> and get the latest executable
(this one could not be the latest) and one or more demos packages.
Then unzip all the downloaded files in the same folder and run
the &quot;APOCALYX.exe&quot; file. 
If you want to modify the demos, remember that the &quot;.dat&quot; files
are ZIP files the extension of which was renamed (they contain
the media files needed by the demos) and the &quot;.lua&quot; files are
text files (they include the code of the scripts), so you can
use your preferred editor and an unzip utility.
Since several languages are supported, I recommend the use of the
<i>Scintilla Text Editor</i> available at <a href="http://www.scintilla.org">http://www.scintilla.org</a>
It provides sintax highlighting for a lot of different languages
and features useful to manage several scripts at once.

The main scripting language supported by APOCALYX is LUA.
LUA is an embeddable and extendable scripting language.
To know more about this language visit <a href="http://www.lua.org">http://www.lua.org</a>
You don't need to know all the features of LUA to write programs
for APOCALYX, so you can simply read the APOCALYX documentation
provided at <a href="http://apocalyx.sourceforge.net">http://apocalyx.sourceforge.net</a> including a &quot;getting
started&quot; guide on LUA (5.1) and the list of the APOCALYX APIs.

Tested on:

OPSYS        - Windows Vista
CPU          - Core2Duo T7300
RAM          - 2048 Mb
GRAPHIC CARD - GeForce 8600M GT 256 Mb
SOUND CARD   - Realtek High Definition Audio

OPSYS        - Windows XP
CPU          - Athlon 64 3700+
RAM          - 1024 Mb
GRAPHIC CARD - GeForce 6200 256 Mb
SOUND CARD   - Realtek AC'97 Audio

OPSYS        - Windows 98
CPU          - Athlon 800 MHz
RAM          - 256 Mb
GRAPHIC CARD - GeForce 256 32 Mb
SOUND CARD   - SoundBlaster Live! 1024

To test the application you need a PC with Windows 98 or higher
and OpenGL installed. Hardware 3D acceleration is required and
the resolution of the graphic card must use at least 16 bits
mode to run the application fullscreen or in a window.

To recompile the application you need the free C++ Borland
compiler and the Code::Blocks IDE, but the use of C++ sources
is provided only for those power-users who want to modify the
inner workings of the engine.
<b>Normal users can program their demos and games using scripts
and no compiler is necessary because APOCALYX already includes
all the tools to interpret/compile scripts.</b>
Anyway the Borland C++ command line compiler is available for
free and so the Code::Blocks IDE.
For more details about the <B>Borland C++ free compiler</B>, visit
<a href="http://www.borland.com/bcppbuilder/freecompiler/">http://www.borland.com/bcppbuilder/freecompiler/</a>
For more details about the <B>Code::Blocks IDE</B>, visit
<a href="http://www.codeblocks.org">http://www.codeblocks.org</a>

You must have installed the latest OpenGL drivers for your
graphic card on your machine, then no other tool is required
because all the DLLs and libraries are included in the
development package.


<a name="donations"><b>2 - Donations</b>
-------------</a>

The APOCALYX Engine and all the related stuff (sources, demos and
games) are provided for free as an open source project. I hope that
my work benefits you as a possible learning tool of particular
coding techniques or as an effective library to be included in your
own programs.

If you find my code useful and want to support further improvements
of the project, you can fund it with donations. The 5% of the
amount you are going to donate will remain to SourceForge.net
for their great hosting service.

Thank you in advance!

<a name="commercial"><b>3 - Commercial Products</b>
-----------------------</a>

Even if the APOCALYX Engine is provided for free, it includes
several libraries that are subject to their own license.

You can find an abstract of the licenses in the <a href="#librariesandtoolscopyrights">Libraries &amp; Tools</a>
section. Not all the libraries listed below are included in any
release of the engine. To discover which are really used in
the executable, right click on the icon of the program to show
the context menu, then on the "properties" item, then on the
"version" tab: A list of libraries will appear.
<!--
<B>If you plan to use APOCALYX for any commercial product, be aware
that some of the libraries require a payment for such an use, while
no problem arise if your product is freeware (just like this engine).</B>

Actually the only libraries that can't be used freely in commercial
products are <B>FMOD</B> and <B>RakNet</B>. The first is used for music and sound
effects but in the latest versions is not compiled in the engine,
substituted by OpenAL, that is free. Anyway a FMOD version is
always available on request in source form.
The second is a networking library with useful functionalities,
in particular for UDP connections, but in the latest versions is
not compiled in the engine. You can replace some of its features
with <b>LuaSocket</b>. Anyway a RakNet version is always available
on request in source form.

If you need to write code that include calls to the libraries
listed above, visit the sites <A HREF="http://www.rakkarsoft.com">http://www.rakkarsoft.com</A> (for RakNet)
and <A HREF="http://www.fmod.com">http://www.fmod.com</A> (for FMOD) to read more information about
their license.

<a name="acknowledgements"><b>4 - Acknowledgements</b>
--------------------</a>

I wish to thank all the people who helped in the development.

First of all, I must thank Matteo &quot;Fuzz&quot; Perenzoni and his
&quot;Apocalypse demo&quot; written for the NeHe's Apocalypse Contest
<a href="http://nehe.gamedev.net/data/contests/contest.asp?contest=03">http://nehe.gamedev.net/data/contests/contest.asp?contest=03</a>
The sources of his demo were the starting point for the
APOCALYX renderer and many nice effects. 

Then I must thank a lot of great internet resources about
game programming:

and many others. 


<a name="howtocompile"><b>5 - How to compile</b>
------------------</a>

If you possess the <B>Borland C++ 5.51 Command Line Compiler</B>
and the <b>Code::Blocks IDE</b> you can recompile the engine using
the project file <I>APOCALYX.cbp</I> included in the <I>dev/src</I> folder.

<B>Remember to set the include path for the resource compiler
in <I>Code::Blocks</I> or the project will not compile.
You can find that setting in the "<I>Settings</I>" menu, then click
on the "<I>Compiler</I>" item, then on the "<I>Directories</I>" tab. Now
copy the path that you can read under the "<I>Compiler</I>" tab
and, finally, click on the "<I>Resource compiler</I>" tab. You
must paste there the same include path already used
for the compiler.</b>

<b>Remember also that normal users can program their demos
and games with scripts and no compiler is necessary
because APOCALYX already includes all the tools
to interpret/compile scripts.</b>

<a name="knownbugs"><b>6 - Known Bugs</b>
--------------</a>

<B>As a rule, you can fully trust only features that
appear in one of the demos provided with the engine.
Report any bug that you may find using other functions.</B>

If you experience severe malfunctions (system crashes),
they are usually caused by old OpenGL drivers, thus
visit the site of your graphic card manufacturer to
download the latest drivers.
Very old configurations are supported (for example,
<I>GeForce with 32 Mb RAM on 800 MHz Athlon</I>) but
executing some demos, tuned for a more performant
hardware, you may experience poor frame rates.

<B>The main bug that made the engine crash in the past
on some configurations was not my fault, because it
was caused by OpenAL. Now the implementation shipped
with the engine is one of the latest from Creative
that works even on my old computer with a clean
Win98 installation and 1999 original drivers.
If you experience problems that you think are
caused by this version of OpenAL, I can provide
an older version that proved to be stable on
obsolete hardware but contains some minor bugs.

All the resources that appear in the demos (e.g. textures, models,
sound effects, midi files) may be followed by a &quot;readme&quot; file that
gives credits to their respective authors. Before using that
resources in your own programs, read which conditions apply,
