250 free handdrawn textures

http://lostgarden.com/2006/02/250-free-handdrawn-textures.html

I was searching through my old archives and came across a
set of 250 textures that I thought were long lost.
Heck, they aren't doing much good sitting on a slowly decaying
CD-R so I figured I'd share them with everyone. 

Use these however you desire. Mash them up, put them in your games.
If you end up releasing a game using these graphics to the public,
all I ask is that you put a link to this website someplace the
nether depths of your credits.

They are a few years old, so they are all 128 x 128 images using
a common fixed 8-bit palette. I also included a text file that
explains the naming convention.

If any of you are new to graphics tiles, here's a little illustration
that explains all the parts. You have a set of 14 titles that can be
used to make any irregular shape and smoothly transition between two
titles. For example. Suppose you had a water title and a land title.
With the transition titles, you could easily create a pretty shore line.

Tile creation is a dying art since modern 3D terrain engines have all
sorts of wonderful blending capabilities for auto generating transition
tiles. But if you are working on a game for handhelds or casual games,
it is a nice technique to know.

Enjoy!
