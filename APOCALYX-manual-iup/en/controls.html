  <p class="MsoNormal">IUP contains several user interface controls. The 
  library’s main characteristic is the use of native elements. This means that 
  the drawing and management of a button or text box is done by the native 
  interface system, not by IUP. This makes the application’s appearance more 
  similar to&nbsp; other applications in that system. On the other hand, the 
  application’s appearance can vary from one system to another.<u1:p> </u1:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">
  <u1:p>But this is valid only for the standard controls, many </u1:p>
  <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">
  additional</span><u1:p> controls are drawn by IUP. Composition controls are 
  not visible, so they are independent from the native system.</u1:p></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Each control has an unique creation function, and all of 
  its management is done by means of <b>attributes</b> and <b>callbacks</b>, 
  using functions common to all the controls. This simple but powerfull approach 
  is one of the advantages of using IUP.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Controls are automatically destroyed when the dialog is 
  destroyed.</p>
